Drones exist since World War II and have not stopped evolving since then.
Nowadays, multiple types of drones are accessible and include sensors and features allowing them to execute complex tasks to facilitate our life, and to make it better.
This projectâ€™s goal is to open a way for drones to execute simple tasks (for now), without carrying any sensor except the navigation ones and a communication system such as Wifi or Bluetooth, in a periodically static indoor environment.
